Counting Frequencies of Array Elements

Given an array nums of size n which may contain duplicate elements.

Return a list of pairs where each pair contains a unique element from the array and its frequency in the array.

You may return the result in any order, but each element must appear exactly once in the output.

Example 1

Input: nums = [1, 2, 2, 1, 3]

Output: [[1, 2], [2, 2], [3, 1]]

Explanation:

- 1 appears 2 times

- 2 appears 2 times

- 3 appears 1 time

Order of output can vary.

Example 2

Input: nums = [5, 5, 5, 5]

Output: [[5, 4]]

Explanation:

- 5 appears 4 times.

Now your turn!

Input: nums = [7]

Output:

Pick your answer

[[7, 1]]

[[1, 7]]
Constraints

1 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
