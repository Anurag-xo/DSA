# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

This repository is a personal collection of notes, practice problems, and solutions for various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) topics. It is organized by programming language and includes implementations in Java, C++, and JavaScript.

## Repository Structure

The repository is divided into the following main directories:

-   `dsa-java/`: Contains DSA implementations, notes, and solutions in Java.
-   `cpp/`: Contains DSA implementations and solutions in C++.
-   `javaScript/`: Intended for future DSA implementations in JavaScript.

### Java Section (`dsa-java/`)

This is the most comprehensive section, containing:

-   **`src/`**: Solutions to problems from platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank, organized by data structure or algorithm type.
-   **`notes/`**: Detailed notes on various DSA concepts, including time complexity and topic-wise guides.
-   **`problems/`**: Links to and descriptions of problems from various online judges.

### C++ Section (`cpp/`)

This section mirrors the structure of the Java section and includes:

-   **`src/`**: C++ implementations of common data structures and algorithms.
-   **`notes/`**: Notes specific to C++ DSA concepts.
-   **`problems/`**: C++ solutions to programming challenges.

## How to Use This Repository

You can browse the directories to find the code and notes you are interested in. The code is organized logically within each language-specific directory.

For the Java code, you can use either Gradle or Maven to build and run the projects, as `build.gradle` and `pom.xml` files are provided.

## Progress Tracking

The `PROGRESS.md` file and the `dsa_tracker.sh` script are used to keep track of the topics covered and the problems solved.
